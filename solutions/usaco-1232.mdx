## Explanation
Note that the characters in any queried string can always be moved around in any order, so the solution might have to do with the parity of the characters. 

Let us define $C$, $O$, and $W$ as the number of respective characters in a substring that is queried. 
When will it not be possible to convert this substring to a single C? 
One case is when $W + O$ is odd, since we can never fully remove these from the string (ie: it is an invariant). 
Another case is when either $W + C$, or $O + C$ is odd because we will always have characters other than $C$ remaining.

With this in mind, can we find the cases when it is possible to reduce the string to one $C$? 
Notice that any two adjacent characters can be turned into any single character or removed: If the two characters are the same, simply remove them. 
Otherwise, convert the first character into a character followed by the second character, and remove the pair of second characters.

Thus, we can always reduce a string to one C iff $O + W$ is even and $C + W$ is odd. 

By calculating $C$, $O$, and $W$ in linear time using prefix sums, we can answer each query in constant time.
## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
